<h2>Function to identify a gene network from top prioritised genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xPrioritiserSubnet</code> is supposed to identify maximum-scoring gene
subnetwork from a graph with the node information on priority scores,
both are part of an object of class &quot;pNode&quot;. It returns an object of
class &quot;igraph&quot;.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xPrioritiserSubnet(pNode, priority.quantite = 0.1, network = c(NULL,
"STRING_highest", "STRING_high", "STRING_medium", "PCommonsUN_high",
"PCommonsUN_medium", "PCommonsDN_high", "PCommonsDN_medium",
"PCommonsDN_Reactome", "PCommonsDN_KEGG", "PCommonsDN_HumanCyc",
"PCommonsDN_PID", "PCommonsDN_PANTHER", "PCommonsDN_ReconX",
"PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC", "PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite", "PCommonsDN_CTD"),
network.customised = NULL, subnet.significance = 0.01,
subnet.size = NULL, verbose = T,
RData.location =
"https://github.com/hfang-bristol/RDataCentre/blob/master/XGR/1.0.0")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pNode</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;pNode&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>priority.quantite</code></td>
<td>
<p>the quantite of the top priority genes. By
default, 10
analysis. If NULL or NA, all prioritised genes will be used</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network</code></td>
<td>
<p>the built-in network. If NULL, the network used for
prioritisation will be used, which is part of the object of class
&quot;pNode&quot;. Otherwise, choose the other network of interest. Currently two
sources of network information are supported: the STRING database
(version 10) and the Pathways Commons database (version 7). STRING is a
meta-integration of undirect interactions from the functional aspect,
while Pathways Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct
interactions from the physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to
control the confidence of interactions. Therefore, the user can choose
the different quality of the interactions. In STRING, &quot;STRING_highest&quot;
indicates interactions with highest confidence (confidence
scores&gt;=900), &quot;STRING_high&quot; for interactions with high confidence
(confidence scores&gt;=700), and &quot;STRING_medium&quot; for interactions with
medium confidence (confidence scores&gt;=400). For undirect/physical
interactions from Pathways Commons, &quot;PCommonsUN_high&quot; indicates
undirect interactions with high confidence (supported with the PubMed
references plus at least 2 different sources), &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for
undirect interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed
references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways
Commons, &quot;PCommonsDN_high&quot; indicates direct interactions with high
confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2
different sources), and &quot;PCommonsUN_medium&quot; for direct interactions
with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In
addtion to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user
can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources,
that is, &quot;PCommonsDN_Reactome&quot; for those from Reactome,
&quot;PCommonsDN_KEGG&quot; for those from KEGG, &quot;PCommonsDN_HumanCyc&quot; for those
from HumanCyc, &quot;PCommonsDN_PID&quot; for those froom PID,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PANTHER&quot; for those from PANTHER, &quot;PCommonsDN_ReconX&quot; for
those from ReconX, &quot;PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC&quot; for those from TRANSFAC,
&quot;PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite&quot; for those from PhosphoSite, and
&quot;PCommonsDN_CTD&quot; for those from CTD</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>network.customised</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. By default, it
is NULL. It is designed to allow the user analysing their customised
network data that are not listed in the above argument 'network'. This
customisation (if provided) has the high priority over built-in
network</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.significance</code></td>
<td>
<p>the given significance threshold. By
default, it is set to NULL, meaning there is no constraint on
nodes/genes. If given, those nodes/genes with p-values below this are
considered significant and thus scored positively. Instead, those
p-values above this given significance threshold are considered
insigificant and thus scored negatively</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subnet.size</code></td>
<td>
<p>the desired number of nodes constrained to the
resulting subnet. It is not nulll, a wide range of significance
thresholds will be scanned to find the optimal significance threshold
leading to the desired number of nodes in the resulting subnet.
Notably, the given significance threshold will be overwritten by this
option</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>RData.location</code></td>
<td>
<p>the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. See <code>xRDataLoader</code> for details</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a subgraph with a maximum score, an object of class &quot;igraph&quot;. It has
ndoe attributes: signficance, score, priority (part of the &quot;pNode&quot;
object)
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The priority score will be first scaled to the range x=[0 100] and then
is converted to pvalue-like significant level: 10^(-x). Next,
<code>xSubneterGenes</code> is used to identify a maximum-scoring gene
subnetwork that contains as many highly prioritised genes as possible
but a few lowly prioritised genes as linkers.
