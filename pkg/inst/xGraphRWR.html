<h2>Function to implement Random Walk with Restart (RWR) on the input graph solved iteratively</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>xGraphRWR</code> is supposed to implement Random Walk with Restart
(RWR) on the input graph solved iteratively. If the seeds (i.e. a set
of starting nodes) are given, it intends to calculate the affinity
score of all nodes in the graph to the seeds. If the seeds are not
given, it will pre-compute affinity matrix for nodes in the input graph
with respect to each starting node (as a seed) by looping over every
node in the graph. Parallel computing is also supported.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
xGraphRWR(g, normalise = c("laplacian", "row", "column", "none"),
setSeeds = NULL, restart = 0.75, max.step = 50, verbose = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class &quot;igraph&quot; or &quot;graphNEL&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>normalise</code></td>
<td>
<p>the way to normalise the adjacency matrix of the input
graph. It can be 'laplacian' for laplacian normalisation, 'row' for
row-wise normalisation, 'column' for column-wise normalisation, or
'none'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>setSeeds</code></td>
<td>
<p>an input matrix used to define sets of starting seeds.
One column corresponds to one set of seeds that a walker starts with.
The input matrix must have row names, coming from node names of input
graph, i.e. V(g)$name, since there is a mapping operation. The non-zero
entries mean that the corresonding rows (i.e. the gene/row names) are
used as the seeds, and non-zero values can be viewed as how to weight
the relative importance of seeds. By default, this option sets to
&quot;NULL&quot;, suggesting each node in the graph will be used as a set of the
seed to pre-compute affinity matrix for the input graph. This default
does not scale for large input graphs since it will loop over every
node in the graph; however, the pre-computed affinity matrix can be
extensively reused for obtaining affinity scores between any
combinations of nodes/seeds, allows for some flexibility in the
downstream use, in particular when sampling a large number of random
node combinations for statistical testing</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>restart</code></td>
<td>
<p>the restart probability used for RWR. The restart
probability takes the value from 0 to 1, controlling the range from the
starting nodes/seeds that the walker will explore. The higher the
value, the more likely the walker is to visit the nodes centered on the
starting nodes. At the extreme when the restart probability is zero,
the walker moves freely to the neighbors at each step without
restarting from seeds, i.e., following a random walk (RW)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>max.step</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer specifying the maximum number of steps that
random walk performs. By default, it is 50</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>It returns a sparse matrix, called 'PTmatrix':
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the seeds are NOT given: a pre-computated affinity matrix
with the dimension of n X n, where n is the number of nodes in the
input graph. Columns stand for starting nodes walking from, and rows
for ending nodes walking to. Therefore, a column for a starting node
represents a steady-state affinity vector that the starting node will
visit all the ending nodes in the graph
</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the seeds are given: an affinity matrix with the dimension
of n X nset, where n is the number of nodes in the input graph, and
nset for the number of the sets of seeds (i.e. the number of columns in
setSeeds). Each column stands for the steady probability vector,
storing the affinity score of all nodes in the graph to the starting
nodes/seeds. This steady probability vector can be viewed as the
&quot;influential impact&quot; over the graph imposed by the starting
nodes/seeds.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The input graph will treat as an unweighted graph if there is no
'weight' edge attribute associated with
