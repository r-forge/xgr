CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add new functions ('xVisKernels', 'xSNPscores', 'xSNP2nGenes', 'xSparseMatrix' and 'xSNP2GeneScores') to control how to define and score modulated seed genes from a list of GWAS SNPs
    
    o Add a new function 'xGRviaGenomicAnno' to conduct region-based enrichment analysis using genomic annotations

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o A new data interpretation system by comprehensively utilising ontology and network information to make a user-defined gene or SNP list more interpretable

    o Enrichment analysis using either built-in or custom ontologies

    o Similarity analysis for calculating semantic similarity between genes (or SNPs) based on their ontology annotation profiles
    
    o Network analysis for identifying gene networks given a query list of (significant) genes or SNPs
